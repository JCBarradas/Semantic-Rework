# Semantic-Rework

## Description
As an aspiring Forntend Dev, I was given a a starter code to work on. My goal was clean it up and most important, give it the right semantic tags to improve accessibility as it was all built on "div". 
I've also given "alt" to all the images which improses not only SEO but people that require assistence.

<strong> After all the Internet is for everyone!!<strong>


To make it a bit clear to follow the CSS code, I have structured it so it follow the Semantic structure and it's flow. Also have added comments to make it clear to what has been done in each section.

## Usage

There isn't a real-world use for this Semantic-Rework repo, this was a ticket trageted to improve the accesebility of the webpage and improve the SEO for better ranking. However you can inpect all the semantic elemments and CSS style by opening the chrome Devtools on your browser. To do so, you can press {CMD+Opt+I}  for Mac or {Ctrl+Shift+C} on windows. When you hover your cursor over each element on the elemets tab, it will highlight that specific element on the webpage and when you clique on it you can also see the CSS styling on the Styles tab.

If you notice something missing and would like to improve the code, feel free to clone this repo, work on a new branch and send me a PR, would be more than happy to do it!
